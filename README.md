# üë®‚Äçüíª Sante - Portfolio

I'm a **Master‚Äôs graduate in Computer Engineering** specialization in **Graphics and multimedia**, with also 5 years of experience in web development across different companies.  
My work and studies spans **full-stack web development**, **3D graphics and 3D processing**, **VR/AR applications**, and **Machine learning**, with a particular interest for interactive applications.

Below you can find a selection of my **university** and **personal projects**, showcasing various tools, simulations, and research I have developed.
